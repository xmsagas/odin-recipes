    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These classic scalloped potatoes are tender, creamy, and delicious. This is the way my mother always made her scalloped potatoes. The key is to heat the milk first!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Â½ onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>9 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter, diced and divided</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 cups whole milk, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Spread about 1/3 of the potato slices into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with about 1/3 of the onion slices. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons flour over the potato and onion. Arrange 2 tablespoons butter atop the flour. Season the entire layer with salt and pepper. Repeat layering twice more.</li>
        <li>Heat milk in a saucepan until warm. Pour enough warm milk over the mixture in the baking dish so the top of the liquid is level with the final layer of potatoes.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
